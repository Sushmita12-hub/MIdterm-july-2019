Explain the entire java life cycle.

A.Life cycle of a java program tells us what happens right from the point when
we type source code in a text editor to the point that source code is converted
into machine code (0’s and 1’s).

There are three main stages in the life cycle of a java program. They are:

Editing the program
Compiling the source code
Executing the byte code

what is class?
A .class is a blueprint that defines the variables and the
 methods common to all objects of a certain kind.


What is object?

ANS:In Object-oriented programming, an object is an instance of a Class.

What is the entry point of an application?
Application entry points are used to control users' access to different
 versions of an application that is deployed on a platform

Why main is static?
static means that there is only one copy of the main function is available.
Java JVM will always look for specific method signature to start running an application,
and that would be public static void main(String args[]).

Which class is the superclass of all classes?

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
what is Access Specifier?

    1.Public: Easily access
    2.	Private: Members can only access
    3.	Protected: Can be access from same package and subclass existing in any package can access.
    4.	Default(No Specifier)

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
ANS:OOP- Object Oriented Program.
    1.	Inheritance:Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires
    all the properties andbehaviors of a parent object
    2.	Abstraction: Implementation hiding
    3.	Polymorphism: It is an ability of an object to make on many form.
    Two types of polymorphism:
    1-	Method Overloading - Happens on Compile time
    2-	Method Overriding?- Happens on Run time
    4.	Encapsulation: Data hiding

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?

ANS:Package in Java is a mechanism to encapsulate a group of classes, sub packages and interfaces.
Packages are used for: Preventing naming conflicts. ...
A default member (without any access specifier) is accessible by classes in
 the same package only.
3 packages are imported by default for each source file.
The package with no name.
The java.lang package.
The current package.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.

          List of API:- Core java API, Google, Android,


Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
ANS:No. To reduce the complexity and simplify the language.

What is method overloading and when it happens?

A.If a class have a multiple methods by same name but different parameters,
it is known as method Overloading. Happen on compile time.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.


A.Exception is event that interrupts the normal flow of program execution.
 Exceptions in Java are something that is out of developers control.Try-catch and throw exception
 two most popular way to handle exception.


What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
A.The static keyword used for memory management mainly.
    Static variables: Static variable is used to refer the common property of all objects.
    		          Static variable gets memory only once in class area at the time of class loading.
    Static method:    A static method belongs to the class rater than object of a class.
                      A static method can be invoked without the need for creating as instance of class.




What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?



Ans:The final keyword in java is used to restrict the users.
    The java final keyword can be used in many contexts.
    Variable: If we make any final variable as final,
    we cannot change the value of final variable (It will be constant).
    Method: If we make any final method, we can override it



What is final, finally and finalize?

A.Final: Final is used to apply restrictions on class, method and variables.
            Final class cannot be inherited,
            final method cannot be overridden, and final variable cannot be changed. And final is ?Keyword?.
    Finally:Finally is used to place important code,
            it will be executed whether exception is handled or not. And finally is a Block.
    Finalize:Finalize is a method.Finalize is used to perform clean up processing just before
     object is grabbed collected.


What is a constructor ?
A.Constructor is just like a method that is used to initialize the state of and object.
  It is invoked at the name of the object creation.

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?


A.A class can have multiple constructors, as long as
 their signature (the parameters they take) are not the same.


If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?

A.All classes have at least one constructor. If a class does not explicitly declare any, the Java compiler
automatically provides a no-argument constructor, called the default constructor.


What is "this" keyword in java ?

 A.There can be a lot of usage of java keyword.
     In java this is a reference variable that refers to the current object,
     and instance variable.


What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?

super is a keyword. It is used inside a sub-class method definition to call a method defined
in the super class. Private methods of the super-class cannot be called. Only public and protected
methods can be called by the super keyword.
It is also used by class constructors to invoke constructors of its parent class.
It is keyword that refers to the immediate parent class object.

What is JVM stand for ?
Ans: JVM: Java virtual machine.


Is JVM platform independent?

Every system has its own JVM which gets installed automatically when the jdk software is installed. ...
An important point to be noted is that while JAVA is platform-independent language,
the JVM is platform-dependent.

What version of java are you using?


What is JAR stand for ?
 A.Java Archive.

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?

A.JDK is for development purpose whereas JRE is for running the java programs. JDK and JRE both contains JVM so that we can
run our java program. JVM is the heart of java programming language and provides platform independence.

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?

JRE is an acronym for Java Runtime Environment.It is used to provide runtime environment.It is the implementation of JVM.
It physically exists.It contains set of libraries + other files that JVM uses at runtime.
 JDK is an acronym for Java Development Kit.It physically exists.It contains JRE + development tools.


What is compile time and run time?

Compile time: A compile time error is a problem such as syntax error (example; }  )
                   or spelling mistake example (string), instead of String.
     Runtime:      A runtime error occurs while your program is running.
                   Sometimes this error can be tough to track down.

What is heap?
A.The heap section contains Object (May also contain reference variable)

How java manage it's memory?
A.Memory management is the process of allocating new
     objects and removing unused objects to make space for those new object allocations.
     This section presents some basic memory management concepts
     and explains the basics about object allocation and garbage collection.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
A.String: String is an immutable class, it cannot be changed.
     StringBuffer: Is the original synchronized version of string Builder
     StringBuilder: String buffer is mutable class that can be appended to,
                    characters replaced or removed and ultimately converted.

What is Singleton class?

 A.Singleton class:We can make constructor as private.
     So that We can not create an object outside of the class. T
     his property is useful to create singleton class in java.
     Singleton pattern helps us to keep only one instance of a class at any time.
     The purpose of singleton is to control object creation by keeping private constructor.

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
A.Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream.
       Deserialization is the reverse process where the byte stream is used to
       recreate the actual Java object in memory. This mechanism is used to persist the object.

when to use transient variable in java?

The Java transient keyword is used on class attributes/variables to indicate that serialization
process of such class should ignore such variables while creating a persistent byte stream for any
instance of that class. A transient variable is a variable that can not be serialized.

Difference between while and do..while loop?

The difference between the two is that the do while loop will continue while the condition is true.
The do until loop will continue while the condition is false. Do while loops are exited after the first cycle
if the condition is false, while do until loops are exited if the condition is true

What is Enum?



What is Iterator?
Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
Ans:
Why is String Immutable in Java?
What is constructor chaining in Java?
The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?


What is JIT stands for?

A.JIT stands for Just In time compilation and JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine.
    JVM is a virtual machine used in Java programming platform to execute or run Java programs.

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
A.whenever we create an object using new operator or by any another means the
    object is allocated memory from Heap and When object dies or garbage collected, memory goes back to Heap space in Java,
    to learn more about garbage collection see how garbage collection works in Java.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?

Being an automatic process, programmers need not initiate the garbage collection process explicitly in the code.
 ... It can choose to reject the request and so it is not guaranteed that these calls will do the garbage collection.
  This decision is taken by the JVM based on the eden space availability in heap memory.


What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?

 The main difference between heap and stack is that stack memory is used to store local variables and function call
 while heap memory is used to store objects in Java. ...  Variables stored in stacks are only visible to the owner
 Thread while objects created in the heap are visible to all thread.


What is reflection in java and why is it useful?

 A.Reflection is an API that is used to examine or modify the behaviour of methods, classes and interfaces at runtime.
 The required packages for Reflection, the “java.lang.reflect” package, allows us to invoke methods at runtime irrespective
 of the access modifier.


what is multithreading in java?


A.Multithreading in java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.
 A thread is a lightweight sub-process, the smallest unit of processing. Multiprocessing
 and multithreading, both are used to achieve multitasking. ...
Java Multithreading is mostly used in games, animation, etc.


What is the use of synchronization in Java?

A.The Java synchronized keyword is an essential tool in concurrent programming in Java.
Its overall purpose is to only allow one thread at a time into a particular section of code
 thus allowing us to protect, for example, variables or data from being corrupted by simultaneous
 modifications from different threads.

What is Framework?

Ans:A framework, or software framework, is a platform for developing software applications. ...

9.DBUnit
10.Robot framework


Difference between jUnit and testNG?

A.TestNG uses test groups, which can categorize tests according to features such as run times. As I said at
the beginning of this column, JUnit 4 and TestNG are similar on the surface. But whereas JUnit is designed
to hone in on a unit of code, TestNG is meant for high-level testing.


What are the dependencies for this project?

A.Dependencies are the relationships of the preceding tasks to the succeeding tasks. Tasks may have multiple preceding tasks and
multiple succeeding tasks. The most common dependency relationship is a finish-to-start relationship. Task P (predecessor) must
be finished before task S (successor) can start.


what is dependency injection in java?
Dependency injection is a concept valid for any programming language. ... According to this concept a class should not configure
its dependencies statically but should be configured from the outside. A Java class has a dependency on another class, if it uses
an instance of this class. We call this a _class dependency.


What is static binding and dynamic binding?

A.Static binding happens at compile-time while dynamic binding happens at runtime. Binding of private, static and final methods always
 happen at compile time since these methods cannot be overridden. ... The binding of overloaded methods is static and the binding of
 overridden methods is dynamic.
